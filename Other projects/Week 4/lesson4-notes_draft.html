   <!--Summary-->
   <p>
      In the modern web, there are many ways to format and structure text on
      the page, including changing the typeface and size, putting it in a HTML
      table, and using CSS columns to modernize text placement on the page.
      Some text consists of special characters that require a certain encoding
      scheme or a specific sequence of characters to represent it in text. The 
      bold (&ltb&gt) and the italics (&lti&gt) tags are used to add emphasis 
      to certain text, although it's been replaced with the &ltem&gt and the 
      &ltstrong&gt tags respectively in HTML5. Other HTML tags used to change 
      the appearance of text include the superscript (&ltsup&gt) tag, the 
      subscript (&ltsub&gt) tag, and the monospaced text (&ltpre&gt) tag. 
   </p>
   <p>
      Before CSS, the &ltfont&gt tag was used to change the appearance of a 
      whole section of text. In CSS3, a "@font-face" rule allowed you to
      define a font that would load into the browser from a local server or 
      other remote server, regardless of whether a user had that font on their
      computer or not. In ibe way to organize text, the list, the three basic 
      lists you can use is the ordered list, the unordered list, and the 
      definition list. To display tabular data, there are the &lttable&gt tags
      to format and structure data in a table. Finally, you can specify column
      number and column gap size in CSS style rules to display text like you'd 
      see in a newspaper.

   <p>What You’ll Learn in This Lesson</p>
   <ul>
      <li> How to use anchor links</li>
      <li> How to link between pages on your own site</li>
      <li> How to link to external content</li>
      <li> How to link to non-Web documents such as PDF and Word documents</li>

      <li> How to add descriptions to links</li>
      <li> Best practices for web page links</li>
   </ul>
   <!--Summary-->
   <p>
      Using the "href" attribute in the anchor tag (&lta&gt), you can insert 
      linksto other pages on your website or to external web pages. When you 
      insert links to other pages on your website, they can be linked with 
      absolute addresses or relative addresses. Relative addresses are 
      preferred because directories can be moved around without needing to 
      changing the links. If two files are in the same folder, then only the 
      name of file of the html is necessary when linking to it. The anchor 
      tag can also be used to navigate to other locations on the same page.
   </p>
   <p>
      When you link to external web content, you must use its fully qualified 
      domain name to link to it. You can use "mailto:" in href to link email 
      addresses, and both "?" and the "&" characters to pre-fill parts of the 
      email, such as the body, the subject line, and the CC. The "target" 
      attribute can be used to open a new window when a user clicks on a link,
      rather than navigating to the link on the same browser window. The 
      "title" attribute can be used to display a message when a user hovers 
      over a link. Hyperlinks can be styled with CSS, and its appearance 
      modified based on how the user interacts with it.

   <!--Summary-->
   <p>
      By adding images, multimedia and colors to your webpage, you can create 
      a modern, visually appealing website. When it comes to background and 
      font color, there are several factors to consider, but the most 
      important is to provide a good contrast between background and text. 
      While there are several options for colors that are simply named, you 
      can customize your color to a high precision with hexadecimal values. 
      Another precise way to customize color,is using rgb values, although 
      the better alternative is rgba, which allows for rgb customization, 
      as well as transparency.
   </p>
   <p>
      The three most common values to define for a CSS style are 
      background color, text color, although there are many more you can 
      define. Adding images fromexternal sources or created by a graphics 
      program can help enhance the visuals of your website. You can use the 
      &ltimg&gt tag to insert images by specifying the src attribute, describe 
      the image with the alt attribute, and specify CSS style rules with the 
      style attribute. You can divide up an image into region with image maps,
      so a user can click on certain part of an image. Like with local pages 
      and external web pages, you can use the anchor tag to link multimedia 
      files. With the &ltvideo&gt tag, you can embed video and audio and 
      specify fallback text in case the browser fails to load the media.
